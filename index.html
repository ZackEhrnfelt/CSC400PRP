          <p>Hello I am Zack, and I will be designing an inventory system for my employer,  RESA Power. RESA Power deals with discontinued breakers, and other miscellaneous electrical equipment. Considering that the parts or breakers themselves are discontinued, it is very hard to determine what is a fair price to our customers. We typically follow the market on used parts. To do this on an excel sheet is very tiresome. Our current inventory system is very outdated, so it is in the companies best interests to have a program created instead of relying on an

            excel sheet for all of our material, equipment, and parts. With a new application, all employees will be able to see if we have an item in stock for an order, or can order more supplies themselves if needed. This will increase our productivity, and will reduce ther down time of employees as well. The inventory was never really an issue at our company, until we were purchased by a corporation and are now subject to questions from corporate (where is this item, how much parts do you

            have in stock, etc). Now, with an updated system, we can have the total costs of materials, along with the quantity as well. I have been working here full time for the last two years and this is the most pressing problem that we have, software wise.

            I am a computer science student at SCSU, and i am graduating this semester. In my free time, i like to take my dog to the dog park ( I have an 8 month old Boston Terrier named Benny) or play basketball. My favorite hobbies include sports, food and fast cars. After graduating i hope to get hired as a software developer, or equivalent in my field of study. I never planned on going to college, so graduating is a huge milestone.</p>
